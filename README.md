# MBIEP

MBIEP is a deep learning framework for identifying essential proteins by integrating Multiple Biological Information, namely subcellular localization, gene expression, and PPI network.

# Requirement

-   Python-3.8.0
-   Tensorflow-2.4.0
-   Numpy-1.19.4
-   Networkx-2.4
-   scikit-learn-0.23.1

# Usage
## Dataset
We provide a zip file of the dataset, which includes the training set, validation set and test set, divided in the ratio of 6:2:2, respectively. Among themï¼š
1. `_emb.npy` file represents the features extracted from the PPI network, we use the node2vec ([https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec](https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec)) techinique to obtain feature representations from the PPI network. Parameters are set as follows:

```python
python main.py --input Gnodes.txt --output _emb.txt --dimensions 64 --walk-length 20 --num-walks 10 --window-size 10
```

2. `_gse.npy` file represents features extracted from gene expression profiles. According to the time step, the control group and the replication samples, we reshape it as (5988, 8, 3, 2).
3. `_sub.npy` file represents features extracted from subcellular localization.
4. `_label.npy` file represents the label of the protein, where 0 represents the non-essential protein and 1 represents the essential protein.

## Model parameter

In the file `model.h5`, we also provide the parameters of the model obtained from training, which you can use to predict essential proteins, or to test our dataset.
